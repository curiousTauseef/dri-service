\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
In the modern world of the 21st century the global volume of digital
data is enormous and is supposed to continue growing exponentially.
It is an engineering challenge to fullfill current and future data
storage requirements. Nowadays, we observe a rapid shift from privately
owned and maintained computer systems toward cloud storage with virtually
unlimited storage capacity, high availability and built-in data replication.
As we more and more rely on digital data, it is absolutely necessary to provide means
of ensuring its availability and integrity. Although there exists well-established
methods for providing data reliability such as error correcting codes, hash-based
checksums, backups and replication, the cloud storage model poses new challenges.
In this model, the data is stored remotely on external storage resources outside of
user control. Although cloud storage providers guarantee service level agreement contracts,
recent cloud failure and unavailability reports suggest that cloud storage is not
free from dangers. It appears necessary to monitor the availability and integrity of
data stored on cloud storage provider. However, network latency, bandwidth and data
transfer fees makes hash-based validation of full content of large amounts of data
inefficient and practically infeasible.\\

In the scope of this thesis we aim to address the problems and risks related to
cloud data storage. As a~result, we designed and implemented a~tool that periodically
monitors availability and integrity of data stored on cloud storage resources. The system
was built on the basis of requirements originating from VPH-Share to enable scientists
to tag datasets for transparent data monitoring and receive notifications in case of data
integrity problems. We carefully examined the existing schemes of efficient data validation
in the cloud. However, they clearly do not take into account current cloud storage limitations.
The main contribution of this thesis is an efficient validation algorithm that with high
probability can detect data availability and integrity errors while significantly reducing
the amount of data transfer to $1$ -- $10\%$ of the original file size. The application was
successfully deployed and evaluated in the production environment of the VPH-Share project.\\

This work is organized in the following way. Chapter 1 provides an~introduction and states
the general objectives of this thesis. General methods of ensuring data availability and
integrity, cloud storage overview and current approaches to data integrity in the cloud are
presented in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 and 4 we present the design and implementation of data
reliability and integrity (DRI) tool in the scope of VPH-Share project. Validation and testing
of DRI is presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 summarizes the work and discusses future work.
